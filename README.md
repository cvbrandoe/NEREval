## NER Evaluation

Here, you will find several code sources for use in the Matriciel project (PEPS CNRS), in particular

- an implementation of evaluation measures for Named Entity Recognition task (classification is not considered) according to the State of art (Nouvel et al. 2015). The algorithm aligns named-entities annotations (and their context) given two input texts. 

- a client for annotating named-entities in French texts using DBpedia Spotlight (remote server or own server).
